Adds 16x16 social media icon links next to the author's name, unique to each author.

== Description ==

This plugin is extremely beneficial if you have more than one author on your blog but it’s also still good to have even if your blog only has one author. What it does is add in social media links to your Contact Info section in your user profile for popular social media sites such as Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook.

Once you fill in one or more of those fields, 16 x16 icons will appear next to your name when your name appears as the author of a blog post. This lets readers easily find your social media information as they read and is completely unique to each author.

== Installation ==

Installation is really simple.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Update the Contact Info fields in your user profile

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The links aren't showing up, what's wrong? =

This plugin relies on your theme using the the_author_posts_link function to generate the author link. If your theme uses it's own hooks or builds the link itself using get_author and get_author_link instead, the plugin will not work properly.
